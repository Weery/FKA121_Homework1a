\section*{Introduction}

Molecular dynamics is a simulation of the movement of atoms and molecules. What is of interest in such a simulations is e.g. the trajectories of the atoms given specific surrounding parameters such as temperature, pressure, crystal formation etc. For this homeproblem we study the dynamics of aluminium atoms in a FCC crystal lattice.\\

For the homeproblems we simulate the dynamics of the aluminium atoms by simulating their interactions. At the start of each simulation the atoms are placed on a FCC lattice with lattice parameter $\unit[4.046]{Ã…}$ \cite{al_wiki}. These atoms are initially displaced about $\unit[5]{\%}$ of the lattice parameter and their velocities are set to zero.

\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/task1/energy.png}
    \caption{For different time-steps the energy evolves differently over time, in the figure we there are four simulations with different time-steps. The time-steps increases with $\unit[0.01]{ps}$ for each simulation and the total energy starts to increase for time-steps of $\unit[0.03]{ps}$.}
    \label{fig:timestep}
\end{figure}

For the simulations we updated the positions and velocities of the particles by applying the velocity verlet algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
\item $v \leftarrow v +\frac{1}{2}a\Delta t, \;$ update velocity from current acceleration.
\item $q \leftarrow q +v\Delta t, \;$ update displacement from current velocity.
\item $a \leftarrow a, \;$ update acceleration from the applied forces.
\item $v \leftarrow v +\frac{1}{2}a\Delta t, \;$ update velocity from new acceleration.
\end{itemize}

For this algorithm to be stable, we need to choose a time-step that conserves the total energy. With the algorithm implemented we can simulate the system and study the time evolution of the total energies. In Fig. \ref{fig:timestep} we can see the implications of different time-steps. We can see that the energy is unstable for $\Delta t = \unit[0.03]{ps}$ and stable for the previous one at $\Delta t = \unit[0.025]{ps}$. To have some safety margin we will, for the rest of the report, use a time-step of $\Delta t = \unit[0.005]{ps}$.

\end{figure}

The third problem was about implementing routines for equilibrating the molecular dynamics system to a specified temperature, $T_{eq} = 500^\circ$ C, at pressure $P_{eq} = 1$ atm. The equilibration was implemented using scaling of the velocities and the total volume, and consquently the positions of the molecules as well. The equations used can be found in appendix D in the molecular dynamics lecture notes \cite{lecnotes}. The goal was to study the temperature and pressure after the equilibration process through constant energy and volume simulation. We also plot the trajectories of a few particles to show that the system is still in a solid state (Fig. \ref{fig:equilibrium500}, lower subfigure).

The three main parameters for the equilibration are the timestep (used in the velocity Verlet algorithm) $\Delta t$ and the temperature and pressure relaxation times, $\tau_T$ and $\tau_P$ respectively. The timestep used was 5 fs and the temperature relaxation time was chosen to be $\tau_T = 100 \Delta t$, i.e. choosing the $\Delta t/\tau_T$ quotient in the $\alpha_T$ calculation to be equal 0.01.

When equilibrating the pressure the isothermic compressibility, $\kappa_T$, is used when computing $\alpha_P(t)$. The isothermic compressibility for aluminium is 0.01385 GPa$^{-1}$ \cite{knowledgedoor}, but $\tau_P$ is instead chosen in such a way thatv $\kappa_T$ is cancelled out. For these simulation we chose $\tau_P = 100\Delta t \kappa_T$.

% parameters: tau, delta t, kappa, 

In order to set the system to a certain temperature, a technique involving scaling all the velocities during a equilibrating state. Since the temperature depends on the kinetic energies which in turn depends on the velocities, the  temperature can thusly be changed by changing velocities. In figure \ref{fig:equilibrium500} we can see the temperature after setting the temperature to $\unit[500]{C^\circ}$. There are some fluctuations in the beginning due to the rescaling of the velocities.


\section*{Problem 4}

    \caption{\textit{Upper left:} The time evolution of the pressure during equilibration. The sudden bump at 40 ps is because the target temperature is changed from 1 500$^\circ$ C to 700$^\circ$ C, causing rapid changes in the pressure. The first equilibration at a higher temperature is to ensure that the system enters its liquid state. \textit{Upper right:} The time evolution of the temperature during equilibration. \textit{Lower:} 3D plot showing the trajectories of three particles during 100 ps after the equilibration.

    \label{fig:equilibrium700}
\end{figure}

The fourth problem was very similar to the third one, with the exception that the system was to be equilibrated to a temperature of 700$^\circ$ C---which is higher than the melting point of aluminium (660$^\circ$ C \cite{wiki-al}). Effectively, what is done is that the system is melted. The target pressure was kept at 1 atm. Other parameters are also the same as in problem 3.

To ensure that the system would enter its melted state, at first, a target temperature of $1\,500^\circ$ C was set which was then lowered to 700$^\circ$ C. The switch can clearly be seen in both the pressure and temperature plots (upper left and right in Fig. \ref{fig:equilibrium700}).

Like in the previous problem, a few trajectories have been plotted (Fig. \ref{fig:equilibrium700}, lower). Unlike problem 3, we see that the particles do not remain close to their starting position for longer times, indicating that the system has indeed melted.

After equilibration to 700$^\circ$ C and 1 atm the average temperature obtained were approx. 714$^\circ$ C and $3.82 \cdot 10^{-4}$ eV/\r{A}$^3$. Similar to the third problem, the average pressure is much larger than intended, but we have not found a way of correcting it.

\section*{Problem 5}

\noindent One interesting thermal property of a material is the heat capacity. We can calculate it from fluctuations in either the kinetic or the potential energies,

\begin{equation}
C_v=\frac{3Nk_B}{2}\left[1-\frac{2}{3Nk_b^2T^2}\left\langle \left(\delta \epsilon_{kin}\right)^2  \right\rangle_{NVE} \right]^{-1}, \text{or}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_v=\frac{3Nk_B}{2}\left[1-\frac{2}{3Nk_b^2T^2}\left\langle \left(\delta \epsilon_{pot}\right)^2  \right\rangle_{NVE} \right]^{-1}.
\end{equation}

From our MD simulations we obtained the values found in {Tab. \ref{tab:prob5}} for $C_V$ when using the potential and kinetic energy fluctuations respectively.
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\caption{Heat capacity obtained by measuring energy fluctuations.}
	\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
		\hline \textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{500$^\circ$ C} & \textbf{700$^\circ$ C} \\ \hline
		$C_V / (\unit{eV/kg\,K})$ (kinetic) & $4.9634 \cdot 10^{-2}$ & $6.7474 \cdot 10^{-2}$ \\
		$C_V / (\unit{eV/kg\,K})$ (potential) & $4.9686 \cdot 10^{-2}$ & $6.7579 \cdot 10^{-2}$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:prob5}
\end{table}

From experiments the heat capacity for aluminium in a solid is found to be $\unit[0.900]{J/g^\circ C}$ \cite{al_heat_solid} and for the liquid $\unit[1.18]{J/g^\circ C}$ \cite{al_heat_liquid}. The ratio of these are $1.18/0.9=1.3111$ which is almost the same ratio we found from our simulations,
$6.7474/4.963=1.3594$.



\section*{Problem 6}

When instead using the relation
\begin{equation}
	C_V = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right)_{N,V}
\end{equation}
to compute the heat capacity, and approximate it with a difference quota, we obtain the results found in the table below.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering	
	\caption{Heat capacity obtained by approximating the partial energy derivative with respect to the temperature.}
	\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
		\hline \textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{500$^\circ$ C} & \textbf{700$^\circ$ C} \\ \hline
		$C_V / (\unit{eV/kg\,K})$ & $6.436 \cdot 10^{-2}$ & $8.131 \cdot 10^{-2}$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:prob6}
\end{table}

If we compare these results to those from the previous problem we see that they are slightly larger and the result for 700 degrees deviates by a larger margin. It's possible that a longer equilibration time would yield a more stable temperature than was obtained now and therefore a more accurate heat capacity. A longer measuring time would also increase the accuracy of the result, as well as doing more simulation and averaging the different results. A $\Delta T$ of 5$^\circ$ C was used here, but further experiementing with this parameter could yield a better result as well.

\section*{Problem 7}

The radial distribution function obtained can be found in figure~\ref{fig:radial}. Using Matlab we find that the first peak is at the distance 2.85 \r{A}, which corresponds to the shortest distance in a fcc structure with the unit cell length of 4.046 \r{A}. This is the distance between one of the corner atoms and a face centered atom close to that corner, which is expected.

\section*{Problem 8}

Below (Fig.~\ref{fig:StaticStructure}) are two approximations of the static structure function. The leftmost figure is obtained by integrating the result from Problem 7 and the rightmost one is obtained via simulation.
